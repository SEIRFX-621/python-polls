# What is this? 

This is the code for part 1-5 of this Django tutorial [Django polls tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/tutorial01/).

Feel free to use this code to check against your own work and to assist in any typo like trouble shooting. 

## Some notes

I've included an venv directory for all those who require them to properly run Django(windows users, i'm looking at you). 

Some helpful documentation for macOS, linux and windows users who are interested in using virtual environments, [Virtual environments in python](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)
